## About this repo

My profile webpage is live at [**jamiegcan.github.io**](https://jamiegcan.github.io/)!

It's an "about me" page for now, but I plan to add my certifications and projects soon.

The raw files of the webpage content can be found in the [`docs`](https://github.com/jamiegcan/jamiegcan.github.io/tree/main/docs) folder of the `main` branch.
