## Ask instead of assuming!

* Assumptions aren't always correct and are often based on stereotypes and biases instead of evidence.
* Ask everyone in the conversation first before discussing potentially sensitive topics.
* If someone says or acts like they are getting uncomfortable over a certain topic or action, just stop it.

## Be inclusive towards all genders

* Affirm each individual's gender identity by using the right name, pronouns, and words.
* Use *they*, *them*, *their*, *theirs* and *themselves* (or *themself*), or avoid pronouns altogether, to refer to a single individual with an unspecified, unknown, or irrelevant gender.
* If you do not know someone, do not assume their pronouns based on their name alone.
* Use gender-neutral words to address a group of individuals with mixed genders.
* Talk about employment benefits and social matters in a gender-inclusive way.

## Be inclusive towards all levels of ability

* Use more objective and neutral words when referring to disabilities instead of words that feel stigmatizing or condescending.
* Avoid using disability-based words in negative contexts such as insults, when the disability itself isn't meant.
* If a disabled individual uses or prefers specific words to refer to their own disability, use them and stick to those words.
* Remember that some disabilities are hidden, and they deserve to be accommodated the same way as physical disabilities.
* Make or provide videos with subtitles.
* Make or provide images with alt text and image descriptions. If information can be presented in text form, just write it simply in text form.
* Write as clearly and concisely as possible.

## Be inclusive towards all needs and preferences

* Treat mental illnesses and disabilities the same way you would treat physical illnesses and disabilities.
* Respect each individual's working style and content needs.
* Organize inclusive events so that everyone can have fun.

## Be inclusive everywhere

* Practice inclusive actions as much as you can both in your professional and personal life.

## Take care of yourself as much as you take care of others

* If ever you accidentally speak or act in a non-inclusive way, correct yourself and move on.
* Try not to draw attention towards specific individuals if you didn't intend to refer to them in the accident.
* If you did intend to refer to them and the accident hurt them, then apologize in a way that is comfortable for them.
* Don't beat yourself too hard over accidents.
