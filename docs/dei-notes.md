title: My notes on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I)
description: These notes are in the public domain, so feel free to share them with or without credit!
---

I have seen businesses who repeatedly use DE&I as a marketing tool but never really showed concrete actions towards making marginalized communities more visible and safe.

Meanwhile, I have met individuals who never claimed to be active with DE&I or any other social responsibility efforts, and yet they are more inclusive in practice than the businesses above, only because they act to make their marginalized colleagues more comfortable in their own spaces.

**DE&I initiatives should work for the benefit of marginalized individuals and not only for the benefit of businesses.** It is not just a marketing toolâ€”it is an expectation to treat everyone with respect and to judge them by what they do instead of what they are.

**DE&I initiatives are not a "waste of time" as others might claim, and are in fact a productive use of time.** I know from experience that the waste of time and energy comes from marginalized individuals trying to ask for basic respect or justifying their existence, doubting themselves, shutting themselves off from others as a form of self-defense, or even sabotaging themselves, others, and/or the organization out of represeed anger. Any of these should no longer be a concern to anyone, marginalized or not. This time and energy can be better spent doing actual work for themselves and for the organization.

Therefore, I would like to share some actionable and impactful DE&I initiatives that professionals can do to benefit both their organizations and marginalized individuals as a whole.

These notes come both from my own experiences as a marginalized person and my observations from meeting other marginalized individuals, similar and different from me, both inside and outside the workplace.

*As I write these notes, I make myself aware of my unique position as both:*

* a marginalized person in terms of ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, who greatly benefits when others do inclusive actions, and
* a privileged person in terms of physical, mental, and language ability, who seeks to use my position of privilege to make others safer and more empowered.

I also recognize that my knowledge is limited like everyone else's, and I may not have covered a topic completely or correctly. Feel free to send me comments and suggestions on these notes through any of the links in my [home page](./index.md).

## Ask instead of assuming!

This applies to all aspects of individuals' lives, including:

* their preferred name
* appropriate pronouns and words to use to refer to them
* languages spoken and understood
* nationality
* location
* contact preferences
* dietary preferences
* other aspects

### Assumptions aren't always correct and are often based on stereotypes and biases instead of evidence.

For example, someone may have a Chinese-sounding name, so others might assume that they currently live in China, when in fact they live outside of China.

If asking is not possible (for example, because the individual had just applied online for a job position), assume minimally using information that the individual has already given about themselves, and be willing to be corrected once you have met them.

### Ask everyone in the conversation first before discussing potentially sensitive topics.

Potentially sensitive topics include, but are not limited to:

* religion
* politics
* sexual content
* death due to any cause
* conflicts of any kind such as war, family conflicts, and community conflicts

Discussions about personal identity can also be potentially sensitive. This includes questions about:

* family, ethnic, and immigration background
* sexual orientation
* gender identity and expression (outside of preferred name, pronouns, and terms of address)
* relationship status

The degree of openness of every individual to each aspect of their identity varies, so it's best to ask first if they're okay with discussing a certain topic.

### If someone says or acts like they are getting uncomfortable over a certain topic or action, just stop it.

Do not ask potentially invasive questions about why it makes them uncomfortable, and take note to avoid mentioning or doing the same thing again.

## Be inclusive towards all genders

### Affirm each individual's gender identity by using the right name, pronouns, and words.

The first step towards inclusion is recognizing individuals as they *are* and not as *you thought they are*.

You might encounter individuals who explicitly come out as transgender ("My name is Patricio and I am in fact a boy, even if you didn't meet me that way") or want to be referred to using different names, pronouns and/or words than the one you were used to ("I feel weirded out at being called 'Sir Guilherme', can you please just use 'Guilherme' from now on?").

Listen carefully to how they describe themselves and how they want to be called. Take their words as they are to avoid misinterpretations.

If you knew them before they came out as transgender, non-binary, or any other gender identity, drop everything you knew about them and train yourself to call them by their correct name and pronouns.

Even if individuals aren't transgender or non-binary, it's still important to not misgender them. This applies especially to women: do not use masculine terms ("spokesman") when you know that someone is a woman ("spokeswoman") or when you are not sure if someone is indeed a man ("spokesperson" or "spox").

### Use *they*, *them*, *their*, *theirs* and *themselves* (or *themself*), or avoid pronouns altogether, to refer to a single individual with an unspecified, unknown, or irrelevant gender.

Be conscious that not everyone wants to be referred using the binary pronouns *she/her/hers/herself* and *he/him/his/himself*, so using "he or she", "his/her", and its variations is inaccurate and grammatically awkward.

Individuals with gender identities that are neither exclusively feminine ("woman") nor exclusively masculine ("man") have existed in many cultures, including indigenous and pre-colonial ones.

By using gender-neutral pronouns and words, you affirm the existence and importance of these cultures that were forcibly erased by colonizers who imposed binary gender identities and stereotypes. Being gender-sensitive is also being culturally sensitive.

### If you do not know someone, do not assume their pronouns based on their name alone.

Individual names are ungendered on their own; it's the language and culture that assigns names to certain genders. For example, "Andrea" is a feminine name in English-speaking cultures, while it is a masculine name in Italian-speaking cultures.

If we are not familiar with a certain culture, say Iraqi culture, then we cannot accurately guess how names from that culture, say "Tahir", are gendered. Some individuals therefore resort to assuming pronouns based on how "feminine" or "masculine" the name sounds to them.

Other names in English-speaking cultures, like "Sam" and "Alex", are considered gender-neutral. Some individuals resort to assuming pronouns based on friends, relatives, celebrities, or others they know who have the same names.

These assumptions come from the culture we grew up in, which may not be applicable to the culture we are not familiar with.

To repeat:

* assumptions aren't always correct, and
* being gender-sensitive is also being culturally sensitive.

Instead of guessing whether to use "she" or "he" on an individual, try the following:

* Use gender-neutral pronouns: *they*, *them*, *their*, *theirs* and *themselves* (or *themself*). For example: "I've only read about Andrea in emails; I think *they* come from Europe."
* Rephrase to avoid pronouns. For example: "Does anyone know Alex Fournier? *This person* left a lunch box with *this name* in the pantry."
* Look up their LinkedIn profile. (Tip: LinkedIn allows users to declare their pronouns.)
* Observe what pronouns others use to refer to an individual, if the other people already know that individual.
* Ask the individual.

### Use gender-neutral words to address a group of individuals with mixed genders.

*Gender-neutral* means that:

* it does not default to masculine terms the way "you guys" or "the IT guys" does, when not everyone in the group is obviously a guy.
* it does not assume only two genders the way "ladies and gentlemen" or "dear sir/madam" does.

Recommended alternatives include:

* "you both"
* "you all"
* "y'all"
* "the two/three/four/etc. of you"
* "hello everyone"
* "hello team"
* "dear client", "dear customer"
* "the IT folks", "the IT people"
* using the name of the team, group, or organization itself to refer to them ("dear hiring committee" or "the software development team")

If you are absolutely sure that everyone in the group you're addressing would use certain gendered terms to refer to themselves and are comfortable with it, then you can adjust your vocabulary accordingly. For example, you can say "hello ladies" to a group of trans women who prefer feminine terms.

Otherwise, you should use gender-neutral terms whenever you're unsure. You can't go wrong with them!

### Talk about employment benefits and social matters in a gender-inclusive way.

Pregnancy and its benefits are not exclusive to women only, because anyone who is willing and able to be pregnant can have any gender identity: cis woman, non-binary, trans man, genderfluid, agender (genderless), or any other possibility.

To better reflect this objective reality, start saying:

* "pregnancy leave" instead of "maternity leave" and
* "pregnant employees", "pregnant individuals", or "pregnant people" instead of "pregnant women" for general discussion of these benefits.

The usual gendered terms can be used for specific pregnant individuals who are actually women (for example: "SofÃ­a is on maternity leave"). When a pregnant individual requests for gender-neutral or masculine terms, we should respect this as well (for example: "CJ is on an extended parental leave").

## Be inclusive towards all levels of ability

### Use more objective and neutral words when referring to disabilities instead of words that feel stigmatizing or condescending.

More objective terms are more descriptive and do not inadvertently assign negative moral value or worth to a disability.

Examples include but are not limited to:

* "wheelchair user" instead of "handicapped person"
* "intellectual disability" instead of "mental retardation"

### Avoid using disability-based words in negative contexts such as insults, when the disability itself isn't meant.

The fact that most disability-based words are only ever used in negative contexts such as insults contributes to the harmful stigma against persons with disabilities.

Certain disability-based words are even considered as offensive slurs (none of which will be mentioned in these notes for the sake of caution). If you are not sure whether a disability-based insult can be a slur, just avoid saying it.

We can criticize without involving disability in our criticisms. Consider the following examples:

* "That decision was *unsound*" instead of "That decision was *dumb*"
* "The stranger has *dangerous* behavior" instead of "The stranger has *psychopathic* behavior"
* "How could the administration be so *oblivious* to the reality?" instead of "How could the administration be so *blind* to the reality?"
* "I feel *very bothered* over the way the books are organized" instead of "I feel *OC* [obsessive-compulsive] over the way the books are organized"

### If a disabled individual uses or prefers specific words to refer to their own disability, use them and stick to those words.

Disabled individuals know better about their experiences and feelings towards their own disabilities, so it's more appropriate to use their own words rather than guess.

In general, there are two ways to describe disability:

1. *People-first language* (for example: "person with epilepsy"), which seeks to emphasize the personhood of those who are dehumanized because of their disabilities.
2. *Disability-first language* (for example: "epileptic person"), which seeks to emphasize the unique experiences and perspectives brought by being disabled, while bringing with it the basic assumption that disabled people are people, too.

Many individuals (including myself) do not know which type of language each disability community prefers. However, we can inform ourselves through:

* observing whether the community and their advocates use disability-first or people-first language
* asking someone with disability what kind of language they would want to be used for themselves and for their community
* exposing ourselves to media and spaces with persons with various types of disabilities.

### Remember that some disabilities are hidden, and they deserve to be accommodated the same way as physical disabilities.

Most of us have been led to believe that disability can only be physical, like when someone is on a wheelchair, wears a hearing aid, or walks with a cane.

In fact, disability can also refer to conditions that do not manifest physically but heavily affect daily living in a way that is not expected of individuals without disabilities. They are called *hidden disabilities*.

Everyone doesn't have to appear visibly disabled to be given accommodations. Everyone doesn't have to declare themselves as disabled to be given accommodations either.

If someone asks for any form of accommodation, like videos with subtitles or extra time doing tasks, give it to them as much as your resources allow.

Avoid asking or assuming why they would request such accommodation. Rather, let them be the one to bring up why they are asking for it.

However, if you do need to ask questions to be able to provide the accommodations (like preferred subtitle language or how much extra time for tasks), then feel free to ask them in the most considerate way.

### Make or provide videos with subtitles and/or sign language interpretation.

The lack of accessible information is a social issue that is not as widely discussed as it should be. While non-Deaf individuals take audios and videos for granted, the Deaf are hugely missing out on news, information, entertainment, and other media that make their lives better.

If life-saving information like disaster and public health announcements are not made accessible, the Deaf will be more prone to injuries and death than non-Deaf individuals.

In addition, while playing videos at a high volume in shared spaces (whether public or private) is a common practice, some consider it impolite. Some just want silence, while others do not want to hear potentially triggering words and topics, and they would be put in an uncomfortable situation if they could not control the noise.

Avoid providing videos that contain neither sign language interpretation nor subtitles, so that users who are not willing or able to hear audio do not miss important spoken content. It also allows videos to be played while muted or at a low volume without sacrificing information.

Some video sharing websites like YouTube can automatically generate subtitles based on the video's dialogue. While they sometimes make mistakes, they can still be helpful in providing context to those who need subtitles.

If you must provide a video without sign language interpretation or subtitles, especially to a large group of audiences, try to take the time to make a transcript or summarize important points of the video in text form.

### Make or provide images with alt text and image descriptions. If information can be presented in text form, just write it simply in text form.

Blind individuals and those with visual problems also suffer from the lack of accessible information that could mean anything from wholesome entertainment to urgent life-saving announcements.

Avoid providing images that contain important text, so that users of text-based assistive technologies do not miss important written content that these technologies cannot read if they are baked into images.

If you have an option to provide alt text to the image, be sure to type the text into it. If not, type the text into the body of your email or social media post.

Some applications like Outlook on desktop can automatically generate alt text for images attached to emails or posts. However, be aware that they are much less informative than automatically generated video subtitles.

If you must decorate your emails and documents, consider changing font styles, colors, and sizes instead of creating text-heavy posters that may be visually appealing but inaccessible.

### Write as clearly and concisely as possible.

This avoids misunderstandings and is also mindful of the diverse language proficiencies of different individuals.

Avoid writing long paragraphs and start breaking them down into smaller ones. Some individuals find long paragraphs hard to read for various reasons. Smaller paragraphs are also more accessible, approachable, and visually appealing, which is good for publicity and marketing.

If the text editor allows for formatting, emphasize important information using **Sentence-case bold face** instead of ALL CAPS. Sentence case is generally more readable than LONG SENTENCES WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS, which helps individuals with visual and learning disabilities.

Avoid emphasizing important information using color alone because color-blind individuals might have a hard time distinguishing them. Consider adding other means of distinguishing text and figures such as **bold** and/or *italic* formatting and filling charts with different patterns for each data (for example: vertical stripes, then horizontal stripes, then crossed stripes).

## Be inclusive towards all needs and preferences

### Treat mental illnesses and disabilities the same way you would treat physical illnesses and disabilities.

Mental illnesses have the same negative effects on productivity and are as life-threatening as physical ones, but mental ones are needlessly stigmatized, are taken less seriously, and are given less resources. It shouldn't be this way.

### Respect each individual's working style and content needs.

Some learn better using videos, some through written documentation, and some others through live training. Some learn best when they learn with others in a classroom-like setting, while others prefer learning alone or one-on-one with a mentor.

It would be more convenient and productive in the long run to let individuals learn and work the way they need instead of imposing one method that doesn't work for everyone.

### Organize inclusive events so that everyone can have fun.

When organizing events, consider the dietary needs of each attendee because they differ based on health, cultural, religious, and environmental considerations. Consider as well if the venue has at least one gender-neutral and wheelchair-accessible bathroom.

If there is a dress code, make it theme-based (for example: business casual, summer outfits, or neon colors) and do not segregate based on genders nor imply that only a certain gender can wear something. It would be enough to illustrate what can and cannot be worn and then let attendees figure out on their own what they would like to wear.

## Be inclusive everywhere

### Practice inclusive actions as much as you can both in your professional and personal life.

The whole point of DE&I is to normalize actions which eliminate negative biases that hurt marginalized individuals, so that they feel more empowered to contribute to society the way they are and not the way privileged individuals expect them to be.

You never know if the next individuals you meet are marginalized, so it's good to be actively conscious. Err on the side of caution if you must!

## Take care of yourself as much as you take care of others

### If ever you accidentally speak or act in a non-inclusive way, correct yourself and move on. Try not to draw attention towards specific individuals if you didn't intend to refer to them in the accident.

The point of inclusive language and actions is that they serve *everyone*, not just the affected individual. It would also make those specific individuals feel awkward if the accident wasn't about them.

### If you did intend to refer to them and the accident hurt them, then apologize in a way that is comfortable for them.

Speaking or messaging privately with them is a good idea.

For me, an effective apology consists of the following:

* It avoids making excuses on why the accident happened (that is, it doesn't say things like "I'm not used to it" or it doesn't try to blame anyone or anything).
* It focuses on the impact on the affected individual (for example: "Apologies for making you feel uncomfortable") instead of your intentions (for example: "Apologies, I didn't mean to exclude you"). Your intentions, even if they were genuine, don't always dictate the impact of your actions on others.
* It says where you went wrong (for example: "It was insensitive of me to assume you were comfortable with the topic").
* It promises to avoid the accident next time through corrective actions (for example: "I will be more mindful in conversations next time").

### Don't beat yourself too hard over accidents.

Remember that DE&I advocates such as myself also took a lot of time and practice to be able to act more inclusively and compassionately.

Everyone is responsible for being patient with each other. Marginalized individuals should be patient towards those who make active efforts to be inclusive despite not being perfect. Privileged individuals should be patient towards those who need accommodations, as well as themselves whenever they make accidents.

By being patient, especially towards yourself, everyone maintains a behavior that is conducive for learning and practicing inclusive actions.
