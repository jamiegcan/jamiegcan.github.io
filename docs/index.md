## My pronouns are *they/them/theirs* or *he/him/his*

Both are okay for me, but I highly prefer *they/them/theirs*. It's always a good thing to represent non-binary individuals more often in daily life!

Example:

> "Did you see Jamie?"
>
> "I saw **them** at the hallway; I think **they're** on the way back to **their** desk."
>
> "Is the lunch box on the pantry table **theirs**?"
>
> "I think so. **They** should clean that up **themselves** soon."

When in doubt, it's safe to avoid pronouns and just use my name when referring to me.

Example:

> "Did you see Jamie?"
>
> "I saw **Jamie** at the hallway, I think on the way back to **Jamie's own** desk."
>
> "Is the lunch box on the pantry table yours or **Jamie's**?"
>
> "I think it's **Jamie's**, the lunch box should be cleaned up soon."

I invite everyone to refer to me using gender-neutral words as much as possible. I'm not fond of titles like "Mr. Jamie" or "Mx. Jamie", even if "Mx." is supposed to be gender-neutral.

Feel free to ask me questions about what words are appropriate to use when talking about me. I'll respond constructively to questions asked in good faith.

## What I Do

I currently work as a data management analyst for a global investment services company and I have been in this job for three years. Before that, I was engaged in data gathering and verification right out of university. I've been working with data for a total of five years.

My undergraduate degree is in the field of social sciences, which is practically unrelated to my current career. However, I take pride in this fact because it shows how flexible careers can be for those who keep an open mind.

During my free time, I exercise and do photography whenever I find myself in interesting events and places. I know how to edit photos and videos, so you can expect me to make posters, slideshows, informational visuals, or even memes.

## What I believe in

I believe that everyone with good intentions have the right to be who they are, and they do not have to explain their existence and background. This is why I respect everyone with good intentions regardless of their identity and background, and I expect others to do the same for me.

I believe that individuals and groups work best when everyone is comfortable in the places they're in. Listening to, representing, and uplifting marginalized groups have a lot of benefits to individuals, businesses, and societies.

This is why I take [concrete actions](./dei-quick-guide.md) to normalize diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) in workplaces and organizations, and I encourage others to take part, too!

## Where I want to be

In my current country of citizenship, although LGBTQIA+ individuals like me are gaining acceptance and society is becoming more progressive, the legal system is too slow to adapt to society's changes. We still do not have rights such as legal name change, legal sex or gender marker change, and queer marriage or civil unions, let alone divorce.

I find it unfair that even if I have the same obligations (like taxes, employment, and voting) as straight and cisgender individuals, I do not get the same rights and privileges as them such as getting common benefits for myself and my partner, having IDs that match my real identity, and not having to be questioned every time I have to present IDs. This goes against my core values of equality and fairness, therefore I disassociate myself from my current country of citizenship.

I want to permanently settle in Canada, where I can get all the rights that I need and still feel safe. I would be very glad to offer my skills to Canadian society and take up the obligations that come with being in Canada, as long as I'm legally recognized and protected as I am.

I know this might take a while to achieve, so I'm willing to further develop my career in the place where I am now while working towards permanent residency in Canada. I want to spend my career in a workplace where I can be myself and I can love what I do, so that I can maximize my time and skills in that workplace.
