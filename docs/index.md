## My pronouns are *they/them/theirs*

* *He/him/his* is also okay, but I highly prefer *they/them/theirs*
* See how *they/them/theirs* is [used in sentences](./my-pronouns.md)

## What I Do

* Five years of professional work in data, including:
    * Three years (and counting) of data management at a global investment services company
    * Two years of data gathering and verification right out of university
* Academic background in social sciences
    * Unrelated to my current work, but I'm still proud of it because it shows how flexible careers can be for those who keep an open mind
* Hobbies
    * Free or low-cost exercise
    * Photography
    * Photo and video editing (posters, slideshows, informational visuals, memes, etc.)

## What I believe in

* Diversity, equity, and inclusion
    * Want innovation? Bring in more diverse individuals with more diverse lived experiences!
    * Try some [concrete actions](./dei-quick-guide.md) now!
* Intersectional and interdisciplinary approaches to things
* Accessibility of information and knowledge-sharing
* AI and human literacy

## Where I am and where I want to be

* Where I am right now
    * Relatively progressive economy and society where LGBTQIA+ individuals are well-integrated
    * However, the state and the laws are too slow to adapt
    * We work as hard and pay the same taxes but we don't have the same rights as straight and cisgender individuals—where's the equality in that?
* Where I want to be
    * Working towards settling permanently in Canada
    * I live, work, and do my societal obligations best as I am, not what the state thinks I should be
