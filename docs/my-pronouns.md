title: Hi, I'm Jamie!
description: My pronouns are they/them/theirs
---

Example:

> "Did you see Jamie?"
>
> "I saw **them** at the hallway; I think **they're** on the way back to **their** desk."
>
> "Is the lunch box on the pantry table **theirs**?"
>
> "I think so. **They** should clean that up **themselves** soon."

Just to be clear about my gender identity: I am one of the many non-binary individuals, visible or hidden, in the past, present, and future world. I do not want to—and should not be—put into one of those two categories that you're all familiar with.

*He/him/his* is also okay for me, but I highly prefer *they/them/theirs*. It's always a good thing to represent non-binary individuals more often in daily life!

When in doubt, it's safe to avoid pronouns and just use my name when referring to me.

Example:

> "Did you see Jamie?"
>
> "I saw **Jamie** at the hallway, I think on the way back to **Jamie's own** desk."
>
> "Is the lunch box on the pantry table yours or **Jamie's**?"
>
> "I think it's **Jamie's**, the lunch box should be cleaned up soon."

I invite everyone to refer to me using gender-neutral words as much as possible. I'm not fond of titles like "Mr. Jamie" or "Mx. Jamie", even if "Mx." is supposed to be gender-neutral.

Feel free to ask me questions about what words are appropriate to use when talking about me. I'll respond constructively to questions asked in good faith.
