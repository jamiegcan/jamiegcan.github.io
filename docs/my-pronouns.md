title: Hi, I'm Jamie!
description: My pronouns are they/them/theirs
---

Example:

> "Did you see Jamie?"
>
> "I saw **them** at the hallway. I think **they're** on the way back to **their** desk."
>
> "Is the lunch box on the pantry table **theirs**?"
>
> "I think so. **They** should clean that up **themselves** soon."

Just to be clear about my gender: I am one of the many non-binary individuals, visible or hidden, in the past, present, and future world.

*He/him/his* is also okay for me in some cases, but I highly prefer *they/them/theirs*. It's always a good thing to represent non-binary individuals more often in daily life!

> "Did you see Jamie?"
>
> "I saw **him** at the hallway. I think **he's** on the way back to **his** desk."
>
> "Is the lunch box on the pantry table **his**?"
>
> "I think so. **He** should clean that up **himself** soon."

When in doubt, it's safe to avoid pronouns and just use my name when referring to me.

Example:

> "Did you see Jamie?"
>
> "I saw **Jamie** at the hallway, I think on the way back to **Jamie's own** desk."
>
> "Is the lunch box on the pantry table yours or **Jamie's**?"
>
> "I think it's **Jamie's**, that lunch box should be cleaned up soon."

I invite everyone to refer to me using gender-neutral words as much as possible. I am a "person", not a "guy" or a "girl" or a "woman" or a "man".

I'm not fond of titles like "Mr. Jamie" or "Mx. Jamie", even if "Mx." is supposed to be gender-neutral. I like being referred to on a first-name basis, but if you must be polite, you can refer to me using my full nameâ€”without the titles, of course.

Feel free to ask me questions about what words are appropriate to use when talking about me. I'll respond constructively to questions asked in good faith.
